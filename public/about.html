    <p>My name is Zachery Favel and I am currently a student at SAIT studying Information Technology Services. I have always been a huge nerd when it comes to technology
        as my father worked in IT as a systems administrator and he was the one who got me interested in computer games which eventually made me develop and interest into how
        computers and technology worked. Aside from technology I also have side hobbies like watching movies and TV shows as well as playing video games as I've been doing 
        those since I was a child. I do also like to stay active and am fans of various sports such as basketball and American football which my friends got me hooked on a few
        years back. I like to think of myself as a welcoming and kind person and am overall very laid back and tend to avoid confrontation. I am always willing to lend
        out a helping hand to people when I can!
